# CS601_FinalProject_Pierantoni
This is the repo for my final project. 
The goal of this was to display a mix of skills in web development from HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Vue while telling a story about me, where I'm from, what I like etc.

The project was copied over to glitch to be hosted

The root to the prject is home.html
