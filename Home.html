        <p> Hi! My name is Dane Pierantoni. As you'll learn more about throughout this site, I was born and raised 
            in the midwest and still currently live there to this date. I will share with you some more things about
            my background including work, education, and some of my favorites. I'm excited to share some things about
            my life here and I hope you enjoy coming along for the ride as well.

            I am currently working towards my Masters in Software Development. I have found that this fast pace program
            is very challenging, especially while working, but also very rewarding. I first discovered web development in
            my intro to programming class during my undergrad. While I enjoyed web dev, I had decided to take a more 
            data/database management focus with my class selection and first job. Since then, I decided I wanted to broaden 
            my knowledge and become more development focused.
